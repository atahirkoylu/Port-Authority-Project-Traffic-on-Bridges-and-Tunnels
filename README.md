# Port-Authority-Project-Traffic-on-Bridges-and-Tunnels
Understanding the factors that significantly influence traffic usage on the Port Authority's bridges and tunnels is crucial for optimizing traffic management and operational efficiency. 

## Project Objection
Understanding the factors that significantly influence traffic usage on the Port Authority's bridges and tunnels is crucial for optimizing traffic management and operational efficiency. Our analysis has identified three primary factors:
 -Weather 
 -Holiday and Special Events
 -Seasonality
## Model and Dashboard
 -Excel: Initial data cleaning and merging.
 -A Time Series Forecasting model was employed using Azure AutoML 
 -The dashboard created in Power BI provides visual insights 
## Data Integration and Preparation
- Data Cleaning: Missing values for traffic speeds, toll payments, and weather conditions were filled using interpolation and averages.
- Feature Engineering: Derived fields for seasonality (Month, Day of Week, Holiday) and weather conditions (Temperature, Precipitation, Wind Speed).
- Data Consolidation: Combined datasets from multiple sources into a unified dataset to analyze relationships.
## Conclusion
-The Visuals and Insights section provides actionable strategies to address traffic patterns, optimize toll enforcement, and manage seasonal and weather-related disruptions.By implementing these targeted recommendations, the Port Authority can improve operational efficiency and traffic flow across its critical infrastructure Recommendations
