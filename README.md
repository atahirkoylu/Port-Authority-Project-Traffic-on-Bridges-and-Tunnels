# Port-Authority-Project-Traffic-on-Bridges-and-Tunnels
Understanding the factors that significantly influence traffic usage on the Port Authority's bridges and tunnels is crucial for optimizing traffic management and operational efficiency. 

## Project Objection
- Identify the factors that affect the usage of bridges and terminals.
- Estimate the number of toll violators (people who do not pay tolls).
- Analyze busiest times and how traffic and speeds are affected by
seasonality, weather, and NYC-related events

## Project Question
-What are the factors that affect the usage of bridges and terminals?
- How many toll violators are there?
- What are our busiest times, and how are traffic and speeds affected by
seasonality and weather?

## Model and Dashboard
 -Excel: Initial data cleaning and merging.
 -A Time Series Forecasting model was employed using Azure AutoML 
 -The dashboard created in Power BI provides visual insights 
 
## Data Integration and Preparation
- Data Cleaning: Missing values for traffic speeds, toll payments, and weather conditions were filled using interpolation and averages.
- Feature Engineering: Derived fields for seasonality (Month, Day of Week, Holiday) and weather conditions (Temperature, Precipitation, Wind Speed).
- Data Consolidation: Combined datasets from multiple sources into a unified dataset to analyze relationships.

## Conclusion
-The Visuals and Insights section provides actionable strategies to address traffic patterns, optimize toll enforcement, and manage seasonal and weather-related disruptions.
By implementing these targeted recommendations, the Port Authority can improve operational efficiency and traffic flow across its critical infrastructure Recommendations
